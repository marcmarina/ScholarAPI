# API for the Scholar app

## Introduction

This serves as the REST API that powers my final year project, [Scholar](https://github.com/marcmarina/Scholar). The API for that project was originally developed with Laravel, but I have now remade it with Node.

## Live Deployment
The project is deployed with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) at [ScholarAPI](https://scholarapi.herokuapp.com/). It uses MongoDB as the database engine.

## Local Deployment
To deploy locally install all dependencies with `npm install`, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set up all the variables. After that, run `npm run dev` and the development server will be started.
